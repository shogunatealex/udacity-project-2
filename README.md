# Would You Rather Project

This is a project used to test knowledge of the redux framework. The application runs on a react redux frontend and a simple backend used to mimic a basic backend for testing purposes. You will be able to choose a user and answer polls as well as see the results of those polls. You can also logout and log back in as a different user. It's important to note that this is not a persistant database. Any refreshes will refresh the "server" on the backend file. So make sure to use the links in the app to keep the information persistant while testing.


# Installation

This app is quite easy to run. 
1. Just clone it into onto your computer. 
2. cd into the directory
3. run : `yarn install`
4. run : `yarn start`

The app should pop up in your browser.

NOTE: you can replace yarn with npm and it should work the same.

## Data

There are two types of objects stored in our database:

* Users
* Questions

### Users

Users include:

| questions | Array | A list of ids of the polling questions this user created|
| answers      | Object         |  The object's keys are the ids of each question this user answered. The value of each key is the answer the user selected. It can be either `'optionOne'` or `'optionTwo'` since each question has two options.

Your code will talk to the database via 4 methods:

* `_getUsers()`

1) `_getUsers()` Method

*Description*: Get all of the existing users from the database.  
*Return Value*: Object where the key is the user’s id and the value is the user object.

2) `_getQuestions()` Method
